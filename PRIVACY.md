# Privacy Policy for Sanctuary

Sanctuary is a browser extension designed to help you reclaim your focus by mindfully blocking distracting websites. We take your privacy seriously.

Sanctuary is built on the principle of **Data Minimization**.

### 1. No Data Collection
Sanctuary does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or the list of sites you choose to block to any external servers. All settings, block lists, and local statistics stay entirely on your own device.

### 2. No Third-Party Sharing
We do NOT share, sell, or trade your data with any third parties. There are no analytics trackers or advertising scripts embedded in Sanctuary.

### 3. Local Storage
Sanctuary uses `chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync` to save your preferences and blocked site list.
- `chrome.storage.local`: Used for local statistics and temporary state.
- `chrome.storage.sync`: Used for your settings and blocked list, which Google may sync across your own signed-in Chrome browsers. This data is not accessible by the developers of Sanctuary.

### 4. Permissions
Sanctuary requires certain permissions to function:
- `declarativeNetRequest`: To block and redirect the websites you specify.
- `storage`: To save your preferences and block list.
- `alarms`: To handle the scheduling of your blocks and bypass timers.
- `tabs`: To detect the active tab and apply blocking logic.

### 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of the extension.

### Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can reach out via the official extension support channels.
